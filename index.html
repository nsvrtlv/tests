 <p>An inner courtyard faces a row of rooms where prostitutes take their clients. The photographer witnesses what should remain unseen. Issues such as prostitution only become problematic when the system, or a society at the service of that system, deem them to be so. Nor would they exist in the absence of a legal framework that lays down the limits of what can and cannot be seen in public. In this context, sex becomes a control mechanism.</p>
 <p>While most cameras today strive to erase any trace of digital noise, here it is exploited to the maximum effect. The exaggerated sensitivity used to cut out the subject also blurs and alters the message. This overpowering noise is our own subconscious, the mental sphere where sex operates as a catalyst for our instinct, our desire and our contradictions.</p>
